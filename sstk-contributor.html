                <p class="project-section-description"> Shutterstock Contributor is a global marketplace that provides a platform for photographers and creators to showcase and sell their work. When the platform was redesigned several years ago, the uploading and submitting design was met with negative feedback as it did not meet user's expectations and they preferred our competitors' experiences.
                <br><br>
                In an effort to right the wrongs, I went back to the drawing board to redesign the experience from the ground up. The goal was to reduce friction between upload and submission to increase contributor submissions.</p>

There focus turned to launching their online auction platform to allow users to conveniently bid on vehicles with a few clicks.

                I had my own ideas going into the project of how the app should be improved but after doing some user research, I quickly learned that users don't use the app to its fullest potential. The primary use for the app is ticketing and purchasing tickets because users can buy them at any time.

All focused on real-time tracking methods but only a few were visual on a map. Nearly every app had a favorites option to access their most frequent stops and a Nearby feature showing what stops are nearest their current location.

                I started with low-fidelity wireframe sketches and then worked up to higher fidelity using Illustrator. I took a linear approach and sketched the ticketing page first because this was the primary use case and I wanted to materialize what I envisioned in my head since the research phase. Then I generated the layout and structure of the functional and data elements for the rest of the app.

                <p class="project-section-description">I spent the most time iterating the interactive portion of the app because I needed to make sure everything was connected correctly and the flows were intuitive.  I inserted the wireframes in Invision to visualize how the app would interact with the users.
                <br><br>
                The feedback I received was that I needed to show value at the beginning of the app instead of making the user register first. I needed to show why they should register first before making them start entering information.
                <br><br>
                The feedback regarding the Transit Tracker for train and bus was that there was a lot of mental processing required of the user to remember what route they chose and which bus stop it was connected to. To improve the favorites use case, introducing a map UI was necessary to make the selection process easier and more visual. This was an issue most competitors had where users would end up in a blackhole of lists to find their station or stop.
                <br><br>
                The ticketing page had issues of knowing what was clickable so I had to make the buttons visually obvious.

                I had to iterate a few times to get the color right making it darker. The font was chosen for its simplicity and readability.

                Overall, participants found the app easy to use. All users were excited to see the inclusion of a visual map when referencing their bus or train stop.
                <br><br>
                A few key areas of the app were confusing to users:
                <br>
                They were confused which elements of the ticket page were clickable. Using Invision limited the availability of an actual interactive map for the users to navigate around, and could only provide screenshots. 
                <br><br>
                To correct these issues, I made the buttons on the ticket page look more like buttons and numbered the descriptions so users knew to start from the top down. There had to be some location disclaimer when performing the tasks of favoriting a stop or looking up a station. Due to time constraints, I was not able to make every station clickable and had to focus on a popular area to showcase how the app would've worked if it was built.
